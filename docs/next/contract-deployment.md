# Deploy Contracts

To deploy smart contracts to Next Smart Chain, make sure your EVM version is set to 'london' or 'paris'.

# Tools

We recommend the use of the following tools to deploy smart contracts. Remix is an ideal tool to compile and debug smart contracts, where Open Zeppelin made a wizard in where a token or NFT can be deployed by a few lines of code.

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [Open Zeppelin Wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/wizard)
